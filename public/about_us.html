        your specified solar requirements with accredited solar power and hot water installation companies that

        <div class="aboutus_heading">HOW IT WORKS.</div>
        <p class="aboutus_text">
        You enter your postcode in the postcode box in the mysolarprice.com.au
        page. From there you will be asked to submit some basic information
        specific to your needs. This should only take about a minute or so of your
        time.<br/><br/>
        This information is then distributed to three independent Solar companies
        who are willing to bid for your business. These companies will then contact
        you shortly after to arrange a time for an appointment or even send you a
        quote via email or over the phone.
        </p>
        <div class="aboutus_heading">WHY CHOOSE US?</div>
        <p class="aboutus_text">
        We make sure that every installer on our books is accredited with the Clean
        Energy Council . We only deal with companies that have been trading for 2
